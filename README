This simple project is an array of LEDs.  Populated with UV LEDs, such a board
might be useful as a PCB exposer for photosensitive PCB stock.

I am considering having this as a parametric design: Enter the dimensions
of the board you want, and a Python script will generate the schematic and
layout to suit those parameters.
